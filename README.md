# 👋 Hi, I'm Ojas

Self-taught Data Scientist discovering Insights

Inspired by pioneers like **Alan Turing** and **George Boole**, I believe that understanding the past of computer science gives deeper meaning to the tools we build today. While I enjoy exploring historical foundations, I'm equally fascinated by the **emerging possibilities of data science and intelligent systems**.
