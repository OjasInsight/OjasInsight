# 👋 Hi, I'm Ojas

I'm a curious mind navigating the world of data, algorithms, and discovery.

Inspired by pioneers like **Alan Turing** and **George Boole**, I believe that understanding the past of computer science gives deeper meaning to the tools we build today. While I enjoy exploring historical foundations, I'm equally fascinated by the **emerging possibilities of data science and intelligent systems**.
